# eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml

Custom ESLint rules for i18n YAML files. Keep locale files consistent by enforcing a default locale, constraining root keys, limiting nesting depth, and keeping keys sorted. (Parity checks for deep keys and placeholders are planned.)

## ‚ú® Feature set

- Ensure a default locale exists at the YAML root (e.g., `en`).
- Restrict root keys to allowed locales and optional meta keys.
- Enforce a maximum nesting depth under each locale.
- Keep header keys and locale blocks in a consistent, alphabetical order (autofix).
- Verify deep key parity across all present locales (or optionally, only against a single locale).
- _(Planned)_ Verify placeholder parity across locales for leaf strings.

## üîß Setup & installation (current state)

This package is **not published to npm** yet. Use one of the following approaches:

**1) Git dependency (recommended)**

```jsonc title="package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml": "git+ssh://git@github.com/YOUR_ORG/eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml.git#main"
  }
}
```

**2) Local folder / submodule**

- Add as a submodule (e.g., `plugins/eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml`).
- Reference it with a local path:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml": "file:plugins/eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml"
  }
}
```

**3) Monorepo workspace**

- Place the plugin at `packages/eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml/` and add it as a workspace dependency.

### Peer requirements

- **ESLint**: v8+
- **Parser**: `yaml-eslint-parser`

### Flat Config ‚Äî Quick start

This plugin ships a Flat Config preset at `configs["flat/recommended"]`.

**Option A ‚Äî Extend the preset (simplest)**

```js
// eslint.config.js (ESM)
import i18nYaml from "eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml";

export default [
  // ‚Ä¶your other configs
  ...i18nYaml.configs["flat/recommended"],
];
```

**Option B ‚Äî Manual wiring**

```js
import ymlParser from "yaml-eslint-parser";
import i18nYaml from "eslint-plugin-i18n-yaml";

export default [
  {
    files: ["**/*.i18n.yaml", "**/*.i18n.yml"],
    languageOptions: { parser: ymlParser },
    plugins: { "i18n-yaml": i18nYaml },
    rules: {
      "i18n-yaml/default-locale-present": "error",
      "i18n-yaml/allowed-root-locales": "error",
      "i18n-yaml/max-depth": "error",
      "i18n-yaml/key-order": "warn",
      "i18n-yaml/deep-keys-parity": "warn",
      // Planned / coming soon (see status under each rule):
      // 'i18n-yaml/placeholder-parity': 'error',
    },
  },
];
```

> **Legacy .eslintrc**: This plugin is Flat-first. There is no legacy preset export; you can still use it with legacy config by wiring `overrides` with `parser`, `plugins`, `settings`, and `rules` manually.

## üìè Rules

### `i18n-yaml/default-locale-present`

**What it is**: Requires the **default locale** (e.g., `en`) to be present at the YAML **root**.

**What it enforces**

- The presence of the default locale key (`defaultLocale`) at root-level.
- If missing, the rule reports the **first key of the file** for visibility.

**Configuration**

- **`defaultLocale`** (`string`, optional): Specifies which locale must always be present in the YAML file. If this locale key is missing, the rule will report an error.

  - **Valid values:** Any 2-letter locale code (e.g., `"en"`, `"fr"`).
  - **Default:** `"en"`

**Notes**

- Case‚Äësensitive match; only checks mapping roots.
- No autofix (the rule cannot infer content for the default locale block).

---

### `i18n-yaml/allowed-root-keys`

**What it is**: Restricts YAML **root keys** to known locales and a small set of allowed non-locale/meta keys.

**What it enforces**

- Every **root-level** key must be in the union of:

  - `allowedLocales` (locale codes), **or**
  - `allowedNonLocaleKeys` (meta/exception keys like `_meta`).

- Violations are reported at the offending key token.

**Configuration**

- **`allowedLocales`** (`string[]`, optional): Defines which locale codes are permitted at the root level of the YAML file. Keys outside this list will be reported.

  - **Valid values:** Any 2-letter locale code (e.g., `"en"`, `"fr"`).
  - **Default:** All known locale codes

- **`allowedNonLocaleKeys`** (`string[]`, optional): Defines which non-locale keys are permitted at the root level (e.g., metadata blocks). Any other non-locale root keys will be reported.

  - **Default:** `["_meta"]`

**Notes**

- By default, the rule permits **all known locale codes** plus the built-in meta keys (`_meta`). To tighten allowed locales, set `allowedLocales` explicitly. To turn off meta keys, set `allowedNonLocaleKeys` to `[]`.
- Keys are matched exactly (case-sensitive). Only mapping roots are checked.
- The provided Flat preset enables this rule without options, relying on the internal defaults. Override per-project by supplying options in your `rules` config if needed.

---

### `i18n-yaml/max-depth`

**What it is**: Caps the **nested path depth** under each top-level block (typically locales).

**What it enforces**

- Depth is counted in segments, including the leaf key: `en ‚Üí a ‚Üí b ‚Üí c` has depth **4**.
- Traversal applies to **mapping nodes**; arrays/scalars are not recursed into.
- A violation is reported when at every key nested beyond the permitted depth. The report occurs at the enclosing mapping node‚Äôs location, with the following data:

  - `locale`: the first path segment (usually your locale code, e.g. `en`).
  - `path`: remaining segments joined with `.` (e.g., `a.b.c`).
  - `currentDepth` and `maxDepth` for clarity.

**Configuration**

- **`maxDepth`** (`number`, optional): Sets the maximum allowed nesting depth for keys in the YAML file. Any key path deeper than this limit will be reported.

  - **Default:** `2`

> Note: `maxDepth: 0` means **no keys** are allowed in the YAML at all. `maxDepth: 1` means no keys are allowed beneath the top-level key (useful for files that should only contain flat locale keys with no nesting).

**Examples**

_With `maxDepth: 3`_

‚úÖ **Allowed**

```yaml
en:
  auth:
    login: Sign in
    # depth: en(1) ‚Üí auth(2) ‚Üí login(3). 'login' is permitted.
```

‚ùå **Disallowed**

```yaml
en:
  auth:
    login:
      title: Sign in
      # depth: en(1) ‚Üí auth(2) ‚Üí login(3) ‚Üí title(4). 'title' violates the rule.
```

**Notes**

- The value set for `maxDepth` will be the last nesting level allowed in the YAML, with the count starting at 1 for root-level keys.

---

### `i18n-yaml/key-order`

**What it is**: Keeps root-level keys in a deterministic order to reduce diffs and improve readability. **Includes auto-fixing.**

**What it enforces**

- Keys are grouped and ordered as:

  1. **meta** ‚Üí in the **configured order** of `metaKeys` (not alphabetical)
  2. **default** ‚Üí the single `defaultLocale`
  3. **locales** ‚Üí all other locales in **A‚ÄìZ** order (case/diacritics-insensitive, numeric-aware)
  4. **other** ‚Üí any non-locale, non-meta keys in **A‚ÄìZ** order

- Reports the entire file when a key‚Äôs position doesn‚Äôt match the expected location based on (1) where the group should be located, and (2) the key's epected intra-group index.
- Provides a single document-level autofix that reorders blocks into the correct order.
- **Comments policy in autofix**: line comments immediately above a key **stick with that key**; top-of-file header comments are preserved at the very top.

**Configuration**

- **`metaKeys`** (`string[]`, optional): Defines which keys are treated as metadata blocks. The order of keys in this array determines the enforced order of metadata blocks.

  - **Default:** `["_meta"]`

- **`defaultLocale`** (`string`, optional): Specifies the default locale to be placed first in the locale order.

  - **Valid values:** Any 2-letter locale code (e.g., `"en"`, `"fr"`).
  - **Default:** `"en"`

- **`allowedLocales`** (`string[]`, optional): Restricts which locale codes are recognized and ordered. Keys outside this list are ignored.

  - **Valid values:** Any 2-letter locale codes (e.g., `"en"`, `"fr"`).
  - **Default:** All known locale codes.

**Examples**

_Before (unsorted)_

```yaml
notes: ‚Ä¶
fr:
  title: Bonjour
_meta: v1
en:
  title: Hello
es:
  title: Hola
```

_Autofix output (with `metaKeys: ['_meta']`, `defaultLocale: 'en'`)_

```yaml
# meta key goes to the top
_meta: v1
# default locale is the first locale
en:
  title: Hello
# all other locales are sorted alphabetically
es:
  title: Hola
fr:
  title: Bonjour
# non-locale, non-meta keys are placed at the bottom and sorted alphabetically
notes: ‚Ä¶
```

**Notes**

- Rule type: `layout`; `fixable: "code"`.
- Sorting within groups uses `Intl.Collator('en', { sensitivity: 'base', numeric: true })` for human-friendly ordering.
- Works only at the **root mapping** level; it does not reorder nested mappings.

---

### `i18n-yaml/deep-keys-parity`

**What it is**: Ensures **all locales share the same nested key structure**. Each locale must contain every key path found in other locales. This is to ensure that every key renders content on the page, irrespective of the language chosen by the user.

**What it enforces**

- For each locale, reports when a path is missing that exists in at least one other locale.
- Paths include nested objects and arrays of objects (see examples below).
- Reports keys that exist on all locales but do not have the same path in each locale.

**Configuration**

- **`singleComprehensiveLocale`** (`string`, optional): Treat this locale as the single source of truth. When set, the rule only checks that this locale contains all keys present in other locales. Missing keys are only reported for the specified locale, and no reports are generated for the others.

  - **Valid values:** Any 2-letter locale code (e.g., `"en"`, `"fr"`).
  - **Default:** Not set.

**Examples**

_Missing key_

```yaml
en: # ‚ö†Ô∏è Locale 'en' is missing key 'text' (expected path: en.text) ‚Ä¢ Present in: 'fr'"
  title: big title
  subtitle: small title
fr:
  title: grand titre
  subtitle: petit titre
  text: contenu
```

_Missing key from object_

```yaml
en: # ‚ö†Ô∏è Locale 'en' is missing nested key 'a' (expected path: en.text.a) ‚Ä¢ Present in: 'fr'
  title: TITLE
  text: { b: 2 }
fr:
  title: TITRE
  text: { a: 1, b: 2 }
```

_Missing deep-nested key from object_

```yaml
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Locale 'en' is missing nested key 'a' (expected path: en.text.a) ‚Ä¢ Present in: 'fr'
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Locale 'en' is missing nested key 'obj' (expected path: en.text.a.obj) ‚Ä¢ Present in: 'fr'
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Locale 'en' is missing nested key 'i' (expected path: en.text.a.obj.i) ‚Ä¢ Present in: 'fr'
en:
  title: TITLE
  text: { b: 2 }
fr:
  title: TITRE
  text: { a: [{ obj: [{ i: 9 }] }], b: 2 }
```

**Notes**

- Paths are represented by joining segments with `"."` (e.g., `en.title`). This can become **ambiguous if your keys themselves contain dots**.  
  üëâ Recommended: also enable case-enforcing rules from [`eslint-plugin-yml`](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-yml/) (`yml/key-name-casing`) or add project-specific rules to forbid dots in keys.
- The rule does **not autofix**, since inserting translations automatically is unsafe.
- Performance is optimized using **DFS and set-based maps**, making it practical even for large YAMLs with hundreds of keys.
